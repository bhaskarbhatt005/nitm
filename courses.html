        <h2>Master's degree Courses/ Programe</h2>
        <h3>What is a Master’s Degree?</h3>
        <p>
          A master’s degree is what you pursue once you have already finished advanced studies in your field. Basically,
          opting for a Master’s degree means that you wish to specialise in a specific area of your study. The master’s
          degree or postgraduate course may be 1 or 2 years long. Some of these courses cost relatively less than the
          under-graduate courses, except a few like Masters in Business Administration (MBA).

          Pursuing a Master’s degree involves undergoing in-depth study in your field such that it enables you to
          demonstrate a high level of expertise in your area of professional practice. Once you are a postgraduate, you
          possess a high level of knowledge and advanced skills and techniques associated with your area of study. This
          is why most companies today look to recruit postgraduate students.

                Merely graduation does not qualify in today’s competitive market. Hence, having post-graduate
                diploma courses give you better weightage and knowledge in different fields.
